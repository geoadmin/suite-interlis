# INTERLIS Test Suite
The aim of the "INTERLIS Test Suite" is to explicitly derive from the [INTERLIS 2.3 Reference Manual](https://www.interlis.ch/download/interlis2/ili2-refman_2006-04-13_e.pdf) a minimum set of rules for the validation of INTERLIS data (version 2.3) and to define related test cases.
The rules and the test cases are available in the directory [doc](doc/README.md): the test files and the corresponding models are available in the directory [data](data).
In addition, a test routine has been developed to run the Test Suite against the tools ["ilivalidator"](https://www.interlis.ch/downloads/ilivalidator) and ["iG/Check"](https://www.interlis.ch/downloads/igcheck).
